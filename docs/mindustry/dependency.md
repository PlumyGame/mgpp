# Dependency

### Import

To apply the dependency configuration,
you have to call `importMindustry()` when [declaring dependency](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html)
inside `dependencies{}` closure in your `build.gradle[.kts]`.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    dependencies {
        importMindustry()
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    import io.github.liplum.mindustry.*
    dependencies {
        importMindustry()
    }
    ```

You can import Mindustry for a specific dependency configuration, such as `ksp` plugin.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    dependencies {
        importMindustry('ksp')
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    import io.github.liplum.mindustry.*
    dependencies {
        importMindustry("ksp")
    }
    ```

MGPP provides `dependency{}` closure for you to configure which version you want to use,
and it's inside of [`mindustry{}`](overview.md) closure hereinafter.

### Arc dependency

You can specify the which Arc version to use with this syntax.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    dependency {
        arc version: 'v136' // a released version
        // OR
        arc version: '47925a7b91' // a commit snapshot
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    dependency {
        arc on "v136" // a released version
        // OR
        arc on "47925a7b91" // a commit snapshot
    }
    ```

By default, mgpp will apply `arc v136`.

##### Notations

- latest: To apply the [latest commit](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc/commits/master) of Arc,
  such as `47925a7b91`.
> **NOTE:** It might not work if you faced the API limit of GitHub or jitpack yet to build this version.
- latestTag: To apply the [latest tag](https://github.com/Anuken/Arc/tags) of Arc, such as `v136`.
> **NOTE:** It has a very small chance that it won't work when the new version was just released.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    dependency {
        arc version: latest
        arc version: latestTag
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    dependency {
        arc on latest
        arc on latestTag
    }
    ```

- [mindustry](https://jitpack.io/#anuken/mindustry): only supports released versions

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    dependency {
        mindustry version: 'v136' // a released version of Mindustry
        // OR
        mindustryMirror version: '558283c6c8' // a commit snapshot from mirror
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    dependency {
        mindustry on "v136" // a released version of Mindustry
        // OR
        mindustry mirror "558283c6c8" // a commit snapshot from mirror
    }
    ```
