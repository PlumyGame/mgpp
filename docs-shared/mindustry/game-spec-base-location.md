**NOTE:** `Client` and `Server` configuration have almost the same syntax,
so in these chapters, `client/server` are used, which indicates that syntax can work both sides.
Please select the proper one.

### Game location

The game location is an abstract file, which represents the Mindustry game.

You can rename the downloaded file with this clause, `named`.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    client/server {
        official version: latest named 'LatestClient.jar'
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    client/server {
        mindustry official latest named "LatestClient.jar"
    }
    ```

MGPP provides some simple clauses for downloading Mindustry:
- [official](#official)
- [be](#bleeding-edge)

#### Official

To download the game from [Mindustry official release](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/releases).  

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    client/server {
        official version: 'v136'
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    client/server {
        mindustry official "v136"
    }
    ```

By default, mgpp will download `v136`.

##### Notations
- latest: To download the latest official Mindustry from [Mindustry official release](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/releases), such as `v126.2`.
NOTE: It will skip the pre-release.

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    client/server {
        official version: latest
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    client/server {
        mindustry official latest
    }
    ```

#### Bleeding-edge

To download the bleeding-edge from [Mindustry bleeding-edge release](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases).  

=== "Groovy"

    ``` groovy
    client/server {
        be version: '22853'
    }
    ```

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    client/server {
        mindustry be "22853"
    }
    ```

By default, mgpp will download a certain version to prevent errors when gradle configuring,
but you shouldn't except this behavior.

=== "Kotlin"

    ``` kotlin
    client/server {
        mindustry fromLocal 'E:/Mindustry/myMindustry.jar'
    }
    ```

#### Overwrite from local properties

You can declare a property mentioned below in `local.properties`,
mgpp will consider it as a path to overwrite what you have already set before

- For `client`: `mgpp.client.location`
- For `server`: `mgpp.server.location`

**TYPE:** String

```properties
mgpp.client.location=E:/Mindustry/client.jar
mgpp.server.location=E:/Mindustry/server.jar
```
